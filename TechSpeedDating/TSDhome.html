        <h1>Technology Speed Dating</h1> 
        <p> Technology speed date is a service that allows college students to have exposure to unique tools and applications that can enhance performance in the workplace. By learning about these various technologies, students can then educate future employers or coworkers about these productivity enhancers. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>Why is it useful?</h1>
        <p>Growing up in the information age, current students and recent graduates are expected to know new  technologies that older generations are not quite aware of. From internships and recent entry level hirings, employers are looking for these young employees to aid the company in new productive ways. Students coming out of college are expected to know “technology hacks” that will help the company be more productive with everyday tasks. <br> <br> 

            The reality is that this does not happen.<br> <br> 
            
            Students rarely know of new applications that can help the company in a new way. Technology Speed date is here to help that ongoing problem and to have our users stand out in the workplace. By having an understanding of new applications and spreading the word about them in the office, the intern or recent hiree is instantly more valuable.  (edit) <br> <br> 
            
            
            It is imperative that students know technological applications that enhance productivity.<br> <br> Check below to get started! <br> <br> <br> ** using Javascript on this page**
